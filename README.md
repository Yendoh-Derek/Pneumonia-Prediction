# Pneumonia-Prediction
This is a model for diagnosing pneumonia from chest x-ray scans.

 The development of an AI module utilizing machine learning to predict pneumonia chest X-rays. This project involved a comprehensive approach:

1.  Data Collection & Preprocessing:  We curated a large, labeled dataset of chest X-rays, ensuring data quality through meticulous cleaning and normalization techniques.

2. Feature Engineering: Advanced image processing methods were implemented to extract relevant features from the X-rays, allowing the model to identify crucial patterns.

3. Model Selection & Training: We explored various machine learning algorithms, ultimately selecting and training a model that achieved high accuracy in pneumonia prediction. Tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch were instrumental in this process.

4. Validation & Testing: Rigorous validation techniques were employed to assess the model's performance and generalizability. This ensured its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
